Hangfire 
=========

Usage
--------

This is how you connect to a ravendb server (local or remote)
```csharp
GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseRavenStorage("connection_string", "database_name");
```

This is how you connect to an embedded ravendb instance
```csharp
GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseEmbeddedRavenStorage();
```

[**Delayed tasks**](http://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/users-guide/background-methods/calling-methods-with-delay.html)

Scheduled background jobs are being executed only after given amount of time.

```csharp
BackgroundJob.Schedule(() => Console.WriteLine("Reliable!"), TimeSpan.FromDays(7));
```

[**Recurring tasks**](http://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/users-guide/background-methods/performing-recurrent-tasks.html)

Recurring jobs were never been simpler, just call the following method to perform any kind of recurring task using the [CRON expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression).

```csharp
RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate(() => Console.WriteLine("Transparent!"), Cron.Daily);
```

**Continuations**

Continuations allow you to define complex workflows by chaining multiple background jobs together.

```csharp
var id = BackgroundJob.Enqueue(() => Console.WriteLine("Hello, "));
BackgroundJob.ContinueWith(id, () => Console.WriteLine("world!"));
```
